### Description  
I created this script as my first-ever PHP project to make complex things easier for users. Itâ€™s specifically designed for handling Bolt.New `.zip` exported projects, helping users install dependencies and address vulnerabilities with minimal effort.  

Key features include:  
- **Beginner-Friendly Approach**: Simplifies dependency management for users who find Composer or npm challenging.  
- **Tailored for Bolt.New Projects**: Works seamlessly with `.zip` files exported from Bolt.New.  
- **Dependency Detection and Installation**: Automatically scans for `composer.json` and `package.json` files and installs dependencies.  
- **Vulnerability Detection and Fixing**: Attempts to detect and resolve vulnerabilities in project dependencies (though this feature might not always work as expected).  
- **Detailed Guide**: Includes a step-by-step guide to make the setup process straightforward.  
- **Debugging and Issue Reporting**: Provides clear output logs for troubleshooting and encourages users to report issues.
